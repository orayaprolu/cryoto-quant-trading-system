# Quant Trading System v2 (C++ Core + Python Dashboard)

This is a modular, performant trading system built with **C++** for quant-style trading strategy development, and **Python** for visualization and analytics.

The goal is to demonstrate strong systems engineering skills, familiarity with quant research workflows, and the ability to build a realistic, production-oriented trading infrastructure ‚Äî with a focus on performance, modularity, and clarity.

## üîß Architecture Overview

- **Data Ingestion**: Real-time and historical data fetched from crypto exchanges via REST and WebSocket APIs.
- **Strategy Engine**: Modular plug-and-play architecture to test multiple signal-generation strategies.
- **Backtesting Engine**: Historical data simulation with configurable parameters like latency, slippage, and commissions.
- **Execution Layer**: Simulated (paper) trading and optional real execution support.
- **Risk Management**: Position sizing, stop loss, exposure tracking, drawdown rules.
- **Performance Logging**: Every trade and system action is logged for review and debugging.
- **Dashboard**: Python-based dashboard (Streamlit or Dash) for visualizing performance, risk, trades, and PnL.
